for /l is your friend:

for /l %x in (1, 1, 100) do echo %x
Starts at 1, steps by one, and finishes at 100.

Use two %s if it's in a batch file

for /l %%x in (1, 1, 100) do echo %%x
(which is one of the things I really really hate about windows scripting)

If you have multiple commands for each iteration of the loop, do this:

for /l %x in (1, 1, 100) do (
   echo %x
   copy %x.txt z:\whatever\etc
)
